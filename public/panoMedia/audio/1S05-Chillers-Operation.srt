00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
All chillers at the Central Cooling 
Plant are YORK MaxE chillers, Model YK.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,620
Each chiller produces a cooling capacity 
of 800 tons using refrigerant R134a.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,640
The chiller consists of an open motor 
mounted to a compressor, condenser,  

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,120
evaporator, and variable 
control or expansion valve.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,900
The chiller is controlled by the Microcomputer 
Control Center that monitors its operation.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,640
The operating status, temperatures, 
pressures, and other information pertinent  

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,780
to operation of the chiller are automatically 
displayed and read on the graphic display.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,020
Let’s look at the water-cooled chiller 
and its diagram in the inserted pictures:

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,720
In operation, water at 54 degrees Fahrenheit from 
the primary circuit flows through the evaporator,  

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,940
where boiling refrigerant absorbs heat, making 
it become chilled water at 44 degrees Farenheit.

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,020
The chilled water is then piped through a 
secondary circuit to buildings around campus.

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,100
From here, it flows through fan coil 
units or other air conditioning units,  

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,379
absorbing heat from the air at terminal buildings.

14
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,399
The warmed water is then returned to the 
chiller to complete the chilled water circuit.

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,060
The refrigerant vapor, which is produced 
by the boiling action in the evaporator,  

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,660
flows to the compressor where a 
rotating impeller increases its  

17
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,480
pressure and temperature, then 
discharges into the condenser.

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,480
Condenser water at about 
85 degrees Fahrenheit flows  

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,660
through the condenser tubes absorbing 
heat from the hot refrigerant vapor.

20
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,440
This causes the refrigerant to condense. 
After the heat absorption process,  

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,220
the condenser water becomes warmer, 
at around 95 degrees Fahrenheit.

22
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,680
It is then pumped into a cooling tower where it  

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,680
yields the most heat energy to the 
fast-moving air inside the tower.

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,000
Afterward, the water flows back to the condenser 
to complete the condenser water circuit.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,200
Meanwhile, the condensed refrigerant drains 
from the condenser into the liquid return line,  

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,220
where a variable orifice meters the flow 
of liquid refrigerant to the evaporator.

27
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,320
This completes the refrigerant circuit.
