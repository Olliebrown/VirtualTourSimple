1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,340
Boiler 1 was a D-type water-tube boiler 
produced by English Boiler in 1953.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,640
It was installed and started 
making steam for the campus  

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,620
in 1965. It was then upgraded 
to a new larger unit in 2005.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,660
Water-tube boilers are designed 
to circulate hot combustion gases  

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,680
or flue gas around the outside of a 
large number of water-filled tubes.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,340
As the flue gas passes through 
the tubes, it heats the tubes,  

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,860
which then heat the water to produce steam.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,400
The tubes extend between an upper header, 
called a steam drum, and a lower header,  

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,340
called a mud drum or sometimes, a water drum.

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,180
Tubes are either straight or bent 
into simple or complex shapes.

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,380
Water-tube boilers are designed 
to circulate hot combustion gases  

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,580
or flue gas around the outside of a 
large number of water-filled tubes.

13
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,620
As the flue gas passes through the tubes, 
it heats the tubes, which then heats the  

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,940
water. As more heat is transferred, the 
water temperature keeps rising until it  

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,460
reaches the saturation temperature and water 
changes phase from liquid to vapor or steam.

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:17,220
Boiler 1 can produce 25,000 pounds of saturated 
steam per hour at the pressure of 100 psi,  

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,280
at a temperature of 338 degrees Fahrenheit.

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,600
The steam is sent out to the buildings on 
campus through an underground piping system.
