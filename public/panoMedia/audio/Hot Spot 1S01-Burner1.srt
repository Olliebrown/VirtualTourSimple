00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,700
Boilers rely on the combustion process of fuel to 
provide the heat required to produce steam inside  

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,580
the boiler. A burner is a group of devices that 
introduce fuel and air into a furnace, mix them  

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,200
together, and provide a platform for combustion 
with the assistance of an ignition device.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,580
The burner incorporates a blower 
that supplies combustion air at  

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,720
a pressure high enough to compensate for 
the airflow resistance inside the boiler.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,540
Like all burners in the plant, 
this burner uses natural gas as  

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,140
the primary fuel and fuel oil 
as an auxiliary support fuel.

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,700
Atomization breaks liquid fuel oil into 
fine particles when admitted into the  

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,440
furnace. Atomization is done mechanically 
by blowing air or steam into the burner.

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,060
Fuel contains some basic elements like carbon, 
hydrogen, and sulfur. Inside the combustion  

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,800
chamber, these elements react with oxygen and 
nitrogen from the supplied air to liberate  

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,500
heat and form carbon dioxide, nitrogen 
oxides, sulfur dioxides, and water vapor.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,080
The university has used natural gas as its 
primary fuel for all boilers to reduce campus  

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,940
pollution emissions. Natural gas emits 
about 50% less carbon dioxide than coal  

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,920
and 28% less carbon dioxide than fuel 
oil. The emission of nitrogen oxides  

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,600
is nearly five times less than burning coal 
and three times less than burning fuel oil.

17
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,840
Three types of heat transfer mechanisms occur 
during the combustion process inside the boiler:  

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,240
radiation, convection, and conduction. 
Each of these mechanisms transfers heat  

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,460
from the burning fuel to the water in the boiler,  

20
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,420
where the combustion air temperature 
can go up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
