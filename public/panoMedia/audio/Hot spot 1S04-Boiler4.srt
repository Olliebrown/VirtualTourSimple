00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
The boiler is considered the heart 
of a central heating system where  

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,440
it generates high-pressured steam and 
sends it to buildings around campus.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,620
Boiler four is an O-type water-tube boiler  

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,940
produced by Cleaver-Brooks and 
was put into operation in 1973.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,720
It can generate about 90,000 
pounds of saturated steam per  

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,080
hour at the pressure of 114.7 PSI and a 
temperature of 338 degrees Fahrenheit.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,800
This section will explain how steam 
is generated inside the boiler.

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,200
Water-tube boilers are designed to 
circulate hot combustion gases from  

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,740
the burner around the outside of a 
large number of water-filled tubes.

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,420
As the flue gas passes through the tubes, it 
heats the tubes, which then heats the water.

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,580
When water is heated in the boiler at atmospheric 
pressure, the water temperature increases until  

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,900
the boiling point or saturated temperature, 
and the volume of water increases slightly.

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,400
Once the water reaches saturation temperature 
(the temperature at which it will boil at  

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,540
that pressure), the water temperature 
remains there even if heat is added.

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,720
The heat added does not increase 
the water temperature, but the  

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,000
water gets converted from liquid into steam.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,500
Bubbles of steam are produced and rise to 
the steam drum on the top of the boiler.

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,020
These bubbles burst and release steam into the  

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,200
space above the steam drum and are 
ready to enter the steam system.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,500
The saturated temperature of steam varies with 
the boiler pressure at which water is heated.

21
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,260
The saturated temperature rises 
when pressure is increased,  

22
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,260
and the temperature goes down 
when pressure is decreased.

23
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,080
For example, the saturated 
temperature of the steam  

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,060
is 212 degrees Fahrenheit at the 
atmospheric pressure of 14.7 psi.

25
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,140
This state of steam is represented 
by point A on a diagram called the  

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,060
Liquid-vapor saturation curve of water.

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,680
Inside the boiler, where the 
pressure is set at 114.7 psi,  

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,960
the temperature of saturated steam increases 
to 338 degrees Fahrenheit at point B.
