00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Attached to the heating plant 
is the central chiller plant  

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,500
that has been operating since 2007, 
consisting of three 800 Ton chillers.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,540
These highly efficient, industrial-grade 
units, provide chilled water to 20 buildings  

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,379
on campus through over ten thousand 
feet of insulated underground piping.

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,680
The chilled supply water enters the 
building and flows through a heat  

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,900
exchanger, absorbing heat from the building space  

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,040
before recirculating back to the central 
plant through a closed-loop return line.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,560
The central heating and chiller plants at UW Stout 
constitute an efficient way of air conditioning  

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,240
and heating the high-density building clusters 
on the campus called District Energy Systems.

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,360
By delivering thermal energy directly in a usable 
form and combining loads for multiple buildings,  

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,880
District Energy Systems create economies of scale 
that drive efficiency and reduce energy costs.

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,440
According to the United Nations Environment 
Program, known as UNEP, District Energy  

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,540
Systems represent a best practice approach 
that can help cities, populated urban areas,  

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,720
and campuses “to move towards climate-resilient, 
resource-efficient, and low-carbon pathways.”

15
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,380
Many equipment, processes, and systems in the 
heating and chiller plants are relevant resources  

16
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,600
for students in environmental science, applied 
science, engineering, and engineering technology.
