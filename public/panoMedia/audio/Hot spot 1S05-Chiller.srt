00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Attached to the heating plant 
is the central chiller plant  

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,680
that has been operating since 2007, 
consisting of three 800 Ton chillers.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,460
These highly efficient, industrial-grade 
units produce a chilled water for supply  

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,300
to 16 buildings on the campus through 
an insulated underground piping network.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,140
The chilled supply water enters the 
building and flows through a heat  

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,360
exchanger, absorbing heat from the building space  

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,380
before recirculating back to the central 
plant through a closed-loop return line.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,240
The central heating and chiller plants at UW Stout 
constitute an efficient way of air conditioning 

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,560
and heating the high-density building clusters 
on campus called "District Energy Systems."

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,020
By delivering thermal energy directly in a useable 
form and combining loads for multiple buildings, 

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,600
District Energy Systems create economies of scale 
that drive efficiency and reduce energy costs.

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,880
According to the United Nations Environment 
Program, usually known as UNEP for short, 

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,900
District Energy Systems represent a 
best-practice approach that can help

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,760
cities, populated urban areas, and campuses 
to move forward towards climate-resilient,  

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,520
resource-efficient, and low-carbon pathways.

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,600
The equipment, processes, and systems 
in the heating and chiller plants 

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,800
are relevant resources for students in 
environmental science, applied science,  

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,080
engineering, and engineering technology.
