00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,540
Boiler 2 and Boiler 3 in the next row are D-type 
water-tube boilers produced by Wickes Boiler  

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,420
in the 1960s as coal-fired boilers and have 
been producing steam at the plant since 1965.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,040
By March 4, 2020, the university made 
the switch to natural gas as the main  

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,880
fuel for all boilers at the plant to 
reduce campus emissions, operations,  

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,020
and maintenance
costs.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,080
According to the United States 
Energy Information Administration,  

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,480
burning natural gas emits about half of the 
carbon dioxide, or CO2, as burning coal.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,760
Using natural gas also helps eliminate equipment 
and labor cost for coal and ash handling controls.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,300
Now, all boilers can use fuel 
oil as a backup fuel source.

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,060
The tubes extend between an upper header, called 
a steam drum, and a lower header, called a water  

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,520
drum or sometimes, a mud drum. Tubes are either 
straight or bent into simple or complex shapes.

12
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,760
Water-tube boilers are designed to circulate hot 
combustion gases or flue gas around the outside  

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,140
of a large number of water-filled tubes. 
As the flue gas passes through the tubes,  

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,540
it heats the tubes, which then heats the water.

15
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,260
As more heat is transferred, the water 
temperature keeps rising until it  

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,420
reaches the saturation temperature, and water 
changes phase from liquid to vapor or steam.

17
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,040
The temperature of saturated steam 
rises when pressure is increased,  

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,740
and the temperature goes down 
when the pressure is decreased.

19
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,060
For example, the temperature of 
saturated steam is 212 degrees  

20
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,100
Fahrenheit at the atmospheric pressure 
of zero pounds per square inch (or PSI).

21
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,540
However, inside the boiler where 
the pressure is set at 100 PSI,  

22
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,980
the temperature of saturated steam 
increases to 338 degrees Fahrenheit.  

23
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,800
A plot showing this relationship is known in 
Thermodynamics as liquid-vapor saturation curve.

24
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,460
Boiler 2 can produce 25,000 pounds of 
steam per hour at the pressure of 100 PSI,  

25
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,039
and temperature of 338 degrees Fahrenheit.

26
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,300
This steam is sent out to the buildings on 
campus through underground piping systems.
