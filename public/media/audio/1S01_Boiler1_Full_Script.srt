1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,758
Boiler 1 was a D-type water-tube boiler produced
by English Boiler in 1953.

2
00:00:05,758 --> 00:00:10,235
It was installed and started making steam
for the campus in 1965.

3
00:00:10,235 --> 00:00:13,733
It was then upgraded to a new larger unit
in 2005.

4
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:18,830
Water-tube boilers are designed to circulate
hot combustion gases or flue gas around the

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,810
outside of a large number of water-filled
tubes.

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,300
As the flue gas passes through the tubes,
it heats the tubes, which then heat the water

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,645
to produce steam.

8
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:32,502
The tubes extend between an upper header,
called a steam drum, and a lower header, called

9
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:35,141
a mud drum or sometimes, a water drum.

10
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:39,025
Tubes are either straight or bent into simple
or complex shapes.

11
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:43,680
Water-tube boilers are designed to circulate
hot combustion gases or flue gas around the

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,700
outside of a large number of water-filled
tubes.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,730
As the flue gas passes through the tubes,
it heats the tubes, which then heats the water.

14
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,649
As more heat is transferred, the water temperature
keeps rising until it reaches the saturation

15
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,396
temperature and water changes phase from liquid
to vapor or steam.

16
00:01:00,396 --> 00:01:06,900
Boiler 1 can produce 25,000 pounds of saturated
steam per hour at the pressure of 100 psi,

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,290
at a temperature of 338 degrees Fahrenheit.

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,537
The steam is sent out to the buildings on
campus through an underground piping system.
