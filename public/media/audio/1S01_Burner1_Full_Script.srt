1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,000
Boilers rely on the combustion process of
fuel to provide the heat required to produce

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,224
steam inside the water-filled tubes.

3
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:12,254
The burner mixes the fuel and air together, and,
with the assistance of an ignition device

4
00:00:12,254 --> 00:00:14,631
provides a platform for combustion.

5
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:19,470
This burner incorporates a blower that supplies
combustion air at a pressure high enough to

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,757
compensate for the airflow resistance inside
the boiler.

7
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:27,609
Three types of heat transfer mechanisms occur
during the combustion process inside the boiler:

8
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:30,372
radiation, convection, and conduction.

9
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:34,858
Each of these mechanisms transfers heat from the
burning fuel to the water in the boiler,

10
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:38,995
where the combustion air temperature can go up to 500 Â°F.

11
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:45,543
The university has used natural gas as the primary fuel
for all boilers to reduce campus pollution emissions.

12
00:00:45,543 --> 00:00:53,509
Natural gas emits about 50% less carbon dioxide than
coal and 28% less carbon dioxide than fuel oil.

13
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:57,782
The emission of nitrogen oxides is nearly
five times less than burning coal

14
00:00:57,782 --> 00:01:00,447
and three times less than burning fuel oil.
